== Description ==
Ninja Users Protocol is a unique, PHP-only WordPress utility designed to add a custom 'Ninja Status' attribute to your users. Acting as a lightweight protocol, this plugin focuses on simplicity and efficiency, providing a straightforward way to manage user states directly from your WordPress admin dashboard.

Once activated, the plugin introduces a 'Ninja Protocol' submenu under the standard 'Users' section. Here, site administrators can view a list of all users and assign one of three distinct 'Ninja Status' levels: 'Active Ninja', 'Inactive Ninja', or 'Pending Ninja'. These statuses are stored as custom user meta data, allowing for flexible integration with other site functionalities or custom queries.

The plugin ensures data integrity and security by utilizing WordPress nonces for form submissions. Upon activation, it thoughtfully initializes any existing users without a predefined Ninja Status to 'Pending Ninja', ensuring a consistent starting point for all. This plugin provides a simple, direct interface for a specific user management need without bloat.
