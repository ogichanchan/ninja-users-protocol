1. Plugin Name: Ninja Users Protocol
2. Short Description: A unique PHP-only WordPress utility. A ninja style users plugin acting as a protocol. Focused on simplicity and efficiency.
3. Detailed Description: The Ninja Users Protocol is a lightweight, PHP-only utility for WordPress that introduces a custom "Ninja Status" for all users on your site. This plugin adds a dedicated "Ninja Protocol" submenu page under the WordPress 'Users' admin section, allowing administrators to easily view and manage this custom status for each user. Users can be assigned one of three statuses: 'Active Ninja', 'Inactive Ninja', or 'Pending Ninja'.

The plugin stores this "Ninja Status" as custom user metadata, providing a simple way to tag or categorize users based on this unique protocol. It features a clear, tabular interface displaying user ID, username, email, roles, and their current Ninja Status, with dropdowns for quick updates. Security measures like nonce verification and capability checks are included for form submissions. Upon activation, the plugin ensures all existing users are automatically assigned a default 'Pending Ninja' status if they don't already have one, establishing the protocol across the user base. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, it offers a focused way to manage a unique user attribute without extensive overhead.
